> **"Code is our weapon. Freedom is our mission. Brotherhood is the protocol."**

Welcome to the **Programming Pact HQ** — a digital stronghold forged by Ethan, Chandler, and Jimmy.  
Here we build bots, bend code, freelance for cash, and train for the cyber frontline.

## Pact Rules

1. **Show up** — Progress beats perfection.
2. **Log your work** — No ghost coding. Push it or write it down.
3. **One mission at a time** — Focus, complete, level up.
4. **We move as a team** — No one left behind.
