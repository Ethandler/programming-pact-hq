# 🧠 OpenAI Model Cheat Sheet: o1 vs o3 vs o4-mini

## 🔍 Summary of Model Strengths

| Model      | Strengths                                                                 | Ideal Use Cases                                                  | Weaknesses                                                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **o1**     | Fast, conversational, lightweight                                         | Quick summaries, structured answers, basic charts                | Shallow reasoning, no live data, approximate values                        |
| **o3**     | Deep research, long reasoning chains, real-time search, accurate data     | Research, schedules, coding, scientific analysis, data synthesis | Slightly slower, more costly on high settings                              |
| **o4-mini**| Very efficient, smarter than o3-mini and o1, best cost-performance ratio  | Mobile/dev work, fast data parsing, code evaluation, CLI tools   | Currently has slightly less tool access than o3                             |

## 🧠 Use These Models For:

### ✅ o3 (High Reasoning + Real-Time)
- Building **itineraries** or schedules from real-world images (e.g. Puy du Fou planning)
- Analyzing **MLB rule changes**, **scientific breakthroughs**, **vehicle performance trends**
- Creating Python **visualizations**, summarizing data across sources
- Real-time fact-checking, **WebGPT-style research**, coding help w/ citations
- Complex workflows (Notion triggers, table mappings, JSON integrations)
- Researching **philosophy, psychology, science**, policy

### ✅ o4-mini (Efficient Reasoning)
- Terminal + **CLI dev agent work** (Codex CLI)
- Efficient **API-driven projects** or cost-sensitive coding tasks
- Fast local use with low latency and high accuracy
- Code audits, script validation, low-resource environments

### ⚠️ Use o1 only for:
- Fast structured explanations
- Lightweight response formats
- Basic outline + filler content generation

- Creating actual charts + comparing Leaf vs Tesla

## 2. ⚾ MLB Pitch Clock Rule → **o3**
Should’ve used o3 for:
- Fetching ERA, WHIP, SO9, BB9 from Baseball Reference
- Explaining stolen base context (bases + pickoff limits)
- Visualizing multi-year trend

## 3. 🎭 Puy du Fou Schedule Planning → **o3**
Already used o3 perfectly:
- Extracted show durations + buffers
- Built time-efficient plan from 12:00 to end of day

## 4. 📊 Cost vs Performance Graph Interpretation → **o3**
Used for:
- Explaining tradeoffs between AIME score and cost
- Understanding why o3 outperforms o1

## 5. 🧠 Human Nature Research Prompt → **o3 or o4-mini**
Ideal for:
- Creating a reasoning-based report with empirical citations
- Pulling cross-cultural and biological data

## 6. 🛡️ Security & Privacy Model Audit → **o4-mini**
Would be useful for:
